Certainly! Here's clear and detailed **documentation** for the latest production-ready Pomodoro Timer React component you have, covering its purpose, usage, state, handlers, and styling points.

# Pomodoro Timer React Component Documentation

## Overview
This is a **production-ready**, fully responsive, and accessible Pomodoro Timer built with React and `styled-components`. Inspired by the best Pomodoro apps, it features:

- Work (Session), Short Break, and Long Break phases
- Configurable Session and Break lengths (1–60 minutes)
- Automatic Long Break after a configurable number of Sessions
- Circular animated countdown timer with smooth stroke progress
- Dark/Light mode toggle with user preference persisted
- Cycle counter displaying how many sessions completed
- Desktop notifications and audible beep at phase transitions
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop
- Clear ARIA labels and accessible controls

## Installation

1. Make sure you have React set up in your project.

2. Install `styled-components` if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install styled-components
   ```

3. Add the `Clock` component file (e.g., `Clock.js`) to your project and import/use it:
   ```jsx
   import Clock from './Clock';

   function App() {
     return ;
   }
   ```

## Component API

### States

| State                  | Type      | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `breakLength`          | `number`  | Length of the short break period in minutes (1–60)                |
| `sessionLength`        | `number`  | Length of the work session period in minutes (1–60)               |
| `timerLabel`           | `string`  | Current timer phase label: "Session", "Break", or "Long Break"    |
| `timeLeft`             | `number`  | Time remaining on the timer, in seconds                           |
| `isRunning`            | `boolean` | Whether the timer is currently running                            |
| `cyclesCompleted`      | `number`  | Number of completed Pomodoro sessions                             |
| `sessionsBeforeLongBreak` | `number`  | Sessions count before triggering a long break (default 4)         |
| `longBreakLength`      | `number`  | Length of the long break period in minutes (default 15)           |
| `isDarkMode`           | `boolean` | Whether dark mode styling is active (persisted in `localStorage`) |

### Handlers and Effects

- `handleStartStop`: Toggles starting and pausing the timer.
- `handleReset`: Stops the timer and resets all lengths, cycles, and timer state to default.
- `adjustValue`: Adjusts the session or break lengths up or down by one minute, respecting limits and disabled while running.
- `switchTheme`: Toggles dark/light mode and persists preference.
- Timer runs in an interval decrementing `timeLeft` every second, switching phases and playing beep and notifications when `timeLeft` reaches zero.

### UI Components & Structure

- **ThemeSwitch**: Button toggling dark/light mode, positioned in the page corner.
- **ControlsPanel**: Contains controls to increment/decrement Break and Session lengths.
- **TimerCircleContainer**: Displays the circular SVG timer with animated stroke progress.
- **CycleInfo**: Shows how many Pomodoros completed out of the configured sessions before a long break.
- **ActionRow**: Contains Start/Pause and Reset buttons.
- **Audio element**: Hidden, auto preloaded beep sound played at phase transitions.

### Accessibility

- ARIA labels and roles are included for buttons and live regions.
- Buttons are keyboard focusable with clear hover and focus styles.
- The timer display announces time left and current phase dynamically.
- The color contrast and font sizes follow accessibility best practices.

### Styling and Responsiveness

- Uses `styled-components` for scoped styling.
- Responsive design with flexible layouts for desktop and mobile:
  - Controls switch from horizontal to vertical on narrow screens.
  - Timer circle scales smoothly between ~335px down to ~215px for phones.
- Smooth transitions on color and timer stroke offset.
- Clean minimal color palette with distinct colors per phase for cognitive ease:
  - **Session**: Purple hues
  - **Break**: Green hues
  - **Long Break**: Orange hues
- Dark mode colors provide comfortable low-light viewing.

### How It Works Under the Hood

- Timer uses React state and `setInterval` for countdown.
- React `useRef` holds current values in the interval callback to avoid stale closures.
- When time hits 0:
  - If current phase is “Session” and cycles completed modulo `sessionsBeforeLongBreak` is 0, switch to “Long Break”.
  - Otherwise, toggle between "Session" and "Break".
- Plays audio beep and triggers a desktop notification (if permission granted).
- The circular timer’s stroke is animated by dynamically setting the SVG stroke dash offset proportional to time remaining.

## Sample Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Clock from './Clock';

function App() {
  return (
    
      My Pomodoro App
      
    
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization Tips

- Adjust colors inside styled components to fit branding.
- Make `longBreakLength` and `sessionsBeforeLongBreak` user configurable by adding controls.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for start/stop and reset.
- Integrate `react-toastify` or similar for toast notifications.
- Store break/session lengths in `localStorage` for persistence.
- Add sound toggle for beep.
